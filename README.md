## Project Overview

Business intelligence dashboard for Google Fiber's customer service team analysing repeat caller patterns and improving first-call resolution rates across three market cities.

### Business Problem

The team needs to understand how often customers call support again after their first inquiry. This will help leaders assess whether the team answers customer questions the first time. Leaders want to explore trends in repeat calls to identify why customers call more than once and how to improve the overall customer experience.

### Success Criteria

The team's goal is to reduce call volume by increasing customer satisfaction and improving operations. The dashboard should demonstrate an understanding of this goal and provide stakeholders with insights about repeat caller volumes in different markets and the types of problems they represent.
